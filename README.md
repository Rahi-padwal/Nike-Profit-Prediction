# Nike-Profit-Prediction
Built a machine learning regression model to predict profit for Nike using pricing, discount, sales volume, and regional features. The project includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training with Random Forest regression, performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R², and analysis of key profit-driving factors.

# Dataset:
The dataset contains historical Nike sales information, including:
Product pricing (MRP)
Discount applied
Units sold
Sales region
Sales channel
Profit
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before modeling.

#Machine learning model:
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
Problem Type: Regression
Target Variable: Profit

#Key Insights
Pricing and units sold have a significant impact on profit
Discounts influence profit non-linearly
Regional and sales channel data contribute to profit variation
Feature importance analysis helps identify major business drivers.
